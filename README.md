<h1>My Coding Journey</h1>
<p> In the beginning, it was all so new,
The languages, the syntax, the things to do.
Staring at a screen, feeling quite lost,
Wondering if the rewards would be worth the cost.

<br>Frustration mounted, mistakes were made,
Debugging errors, progress often delayed.
But with each challenge, a lesson learned,
Slowly, the passion within me burned.

<br>Lines of code, a puzzle to unfold,
Discovering ways to make stories told.
From simple scripts to complex designs,
My coding journey, a path that realigns.

<br>The struggle was real, the path was steep,
But with perseverance, I learned to leap.
Coding became a creative art,
Filling my mind, capturing my heart.

<br>Now, I stand tall, a coder's pride,
Embracing the journey, no longer to hide.
From novice to expert, a transformation true,
My coding journey, a triumph for me and you. </p>
